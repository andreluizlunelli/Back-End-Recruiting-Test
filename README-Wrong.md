/**
 * First question.
 *
 * As a customer I need a REST API to manage a TO DO LIST. It should be able to deal with these four basic operations:
 	- create
 	- get(list and specific item)
 	- update
 	- delete
 *
 * Entity:
 * {
      "uuid": "",
      "type": "",
      "content": "",
      "date_created": ""
   }
 *
 * Acceptance criteria.
 *  - UUID should be handled automatically during create and it should be unique.
 *  - Type should allow only "note" or "reminder".
 *  - Content should not be null.
 *  - Date created should be handled automatically during create.
 */

 * Second question.
